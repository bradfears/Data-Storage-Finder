## Background
The original version of the Data Storage Finder (DSF) was created by the Cornell University Data Management Service Group and Information Technologies Custom Development Group. The original DSF was a Drupal extension written for Drupal 8. The Cornell DSF works on Drupal 10 with some slight modifications, but the source code repository has not been updated in several years. This new version of the DSF was written in PHP/JQuery/CSS and uses a MySQL/MariaDB database. Though some features are different from the original DSF, the primary functionality remains the same.
